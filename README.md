## Analysis
The analysis includes but is not limited to:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and patterns of different types of crimes.
- Time-series analysis to identify trends and seasonality in crime occurrences.
- Geospatial analysis to visualize the distribution of crimes on a map and identify high-crime areas.
- Statistical modeling to predict future crime occurrences or understand factors influencing crime rates.

## Usage
